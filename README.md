An easy-to-use software that allows you to control time in Half Sword. Adjust time dilation dynamically with a simple slider or hotkey, offering seamless control for slow-motion effects or hyper speed.


## How to use?
```bash
   1 - Install the TimeControl.exe
   2 - Open it before or after launching Half Sword
   3 - You can now press the assigned key to change the time.
```

## Questions
   - When I download it or check on VirusTotal, it shows virus detections. Why?
         This happens because the mod includes functions like WriteMemory and ReadMemory
         to interact directly with the game’s memory. These functions are commonly flagged by antivirus
﻿﻿         software as potentially harmful, even though they used here solely to change specific in-game values,
         such as altering the time for the slow-motion effect.

   - I still want to play with the mod, but I'm unsure because of these issues.
﻿  ﻿       Since the project is open source, you can check out the code on GitHub and even compile it yourself for added assurance.
         The part of the code that modifies the values is primarily located in ui.cpp
